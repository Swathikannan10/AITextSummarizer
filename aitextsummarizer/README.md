System Developed:
This project demonstrates a simple end-to-end Generative AI workflow
that summarizes long text into concise summaries using prompt engineering and API-based model integration.

Features:
- Summarizes long text into short, clear summaries.
- API integration using Python.
- Prompt design explained.
- Sample outputs included.

Project Structure:
- summarizer_api.py : API-based implementation
- summarizer_mock.py : Demo version without API
- prompts.txt : Prompt used
- sample_outputs.txt : Example outputs

Note:
Live API execution depends on API access and billing.
Sample outputs are provided for demonstration.
